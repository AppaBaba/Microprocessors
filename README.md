# Microprocessors
 Progarmming Microprocessor in the 70s using singleboard trainers and 8bit Systems.

I decided to go work as an IT person to learn more about mainframes before they all disappear. A funny thing happens the day before I went to my IT job, IBM announced the PC. About a year into the IT job PCs became my bread and butter.  So even though I worked on PCs I did not get one for my self for several years because I had some 8bit machines that I could make them work for me for whatever. When I got my first PC after I wrote a few assembly programs. Then, I started running emulators for 8bit microprocessors on it. I also started collecting 8bit systems until I had a whole room of 8bit system. Back then ran emulators with retro software and then verify that they would run on a real system. I specially like to recompile original software and OS when ever the source code became public. That meant I had to run an emulator along with the development system, tool chain also. The first thing I do with any computer after it has the OS is to start installing development software.
